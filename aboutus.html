            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to <strong>Aahar Aashirwad</strong>!</p>
            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Aahar Aashirwad is a community-driven initiative developed during our internship with IBM. Our mission is to combat food waste and hunger in Amritsar, Punjab, by connecting individuals with surplus food to local NGOs dedicated to feeding those in need.</p>
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>In Amritsar, where food abundance and scarcity coexist, our mission is twofold:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce Food Waste:</strong> By providing an easy-to-use platform, we encourage individuals and businesses to donate excess food, ensuring it doesn't end up in landfills.</li>
                <li><strong>Feed the Hungry:</strong> We collaborate with trusted local NGOs to ensure that the donated food reaches those who need it most, making a meaningful impact on our community.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The idea for this platform was born during our internship with IBM, where we were inspired by the potential of technology to address pressing social issues. Recognizing the need for a local solution in Amritsar, we developed this platform to streamline the process of food donation and distribution, leveraging IBM's technological expertise and our passion for social good.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Donation:</strong> Individuals and businesses with surplus food can easily list their donations on our platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Our partnered NGOs are notified of available donations and arrange for collection.</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> The collected food is then distributed to those in need, ensuring it reaches hungry mouths swiftly and safely.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Join Us</h3>
            <p>Whether youâ€™re an individual with extra food or a business looking to contribute to the community, your involvement can make a huge difference. By working together, we can minimize food waste and ensure that everyone in Amritsar has access to nutritious meals.</p>
